# Web-Shop-API

## Description
            
This is a back end API that will let users access data stored in the database as well as manipulate that data
                       
## Installation

users need to first install nodeJS and Insomnia if they haven't already as well as insuring they have installed the dependencies for this program; Sequelize, DotENV, Express, and MySQL2.
            
## Usage
            
Users will start by sourcing the schema through mysql. After sourcing the schema users will then have to seed the database by running node seeds/index.js. After a user has completed this step they will then have to start the server by running node server.js. After users have completed this action the server is now live and can be accessed. In order for users to access the database they will then have to open Insomnia as well as set the appropriate routes in Insomnia. Once users have completed that set up then they are ready to add or delete items from the database as they see fit, as well as update item,s that are currently or would be added to the database.

## Credits
